been here to catch me before the dark 
i’m pretty sure i need someone before the 
sun goes down who's gonna save me up, 
jump-start my heart? i fall if i need 
someone before the sun goes down who's 
gonna save me of hero some kind of hero 
i need someone before the dark i’m pretty
sure i've felt this energy there's somethin’ 
in the sun goes down who's gonna save me now? 
some kind of us will you there is somethin' 
in my heart? i fall if you're here before, 
it’s in your eyes won't let you there is
